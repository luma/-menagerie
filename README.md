# Menagerie

My notes on various technical topics. These are being produced from an older version of my notes so this is very much WIP

At this point the only section that is in here is [Distributed Systems](distributed_systems/) which is also not complete.


## Usage and feedback

If you find these useful feel free to fork. If you have corrections or improvements please open an issue or pull request.

Where I'm quoting or referencing existing works there should always be a link back to the relevant paper or website. I may have borrowed a few images along the way, I need to review this and credit or replace as appropriate.

If you notice anywhere that I haven't credited the original sources please create an issue.

# Sorting

two "best" sorting algos are
* quick sort Time worst O(n2) best O(n log n) average O(n log n). Space: O(n) or O(log n) auxiliary (Sedgewick 1978). Is not stable
* merge sort Time (worst, best, and average): O(n log n). Space: O(n). Is stable
* insertion sort: Time worst O(n^2) best O(n) (Where the data is already in sorted order) average O(n^2. Space: O(n). Is stable.
